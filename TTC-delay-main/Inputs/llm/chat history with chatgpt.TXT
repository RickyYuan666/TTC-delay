Here’s the conversation up to the final confirmation of the three figures:

---

**User:**  
Write R code to do some plotting about this CSV data.

---

**Assistant:**  
Here’s some R code to generate useful visualizations of the TTC delay data, including histograms for delay times, bar charts for delay reasons, and a time series plot for delays over time.

### Load and Inspect Data
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the data (adjust the file path as needed)
data <- read_csv("path_to_your_csv_file.csv")

# Inspect the data
head(data)
summary(data)
```

### Plot 1: Histogram of Delay Times
```r
# Plot histogram of delay durations (Min Delay)
ggplot(data, aes(x = `Min Delay`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Delay Durations (Minutes)",
       x = "Delay Duration (Minutes)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Plot 2: Bar Chart of Delay Reasons (Codes)
```r
# Count delay reasons (Code) and create a bar chart
data %>%
  group_by(Code) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Code, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "tomato") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Delay Reasons",
       x = "Delay Reason Code",
       y = "Count of Delays") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

### Plot 3: Time Series Plot of Delays Over Time
```r
# Convert Date to Date type
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date)

# Plot total delay duration over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = `Min Delay`)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Delay Duration Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Delay Duration (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

**User:**  
I select Plot 3, give me labels and fig-cap.

---

**Assistant:**  
Here’s how you can add labels and a figure caption to your time series plot (Plot 3) in RMarkdown format:

```r
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-delay-duration-over-time
#| fig-cap: "Delay duration over time in the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system in 2023."

#### Delay Duration Over Time ####
# Convert Date to Date type
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date)

# Plot total delay duration over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = `Min Delay`)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Delay Duration Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Delay Duration (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

**User:**  
The plot is crowded; it’s not as clear as you described. Why is that?

---

**Assistant:**  
The plot might feel crowded because the data points are continuous over time without enough aggregation or smoothing. To improve clarity, here are a few suggestions and an updated R code to resolve overplotting:

1. **Reduce Overplotting**: Use transparency or plot a rolling average.
2. **Use Aggregation**: Aggregate data by week or month.
3. **Change Plot Type**: Use boxplots or other alternatives.

Here’s a new version with smoothing and aggregation:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)

# Convert Date to Date format
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date)

# Calculate rolling average for smoothing
data$RollingAvg <- rollmean(data$`Min Delay`, k = 7, fill = NA)

# Plot with rolling average
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Min Delay`), color = "lightgreen", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = RollingAvg), color = "darkgreen", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Delay Duration Over Time (Smoothed)",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Delay Duration (Minutes)",
       caption = "Rolling average applied to smooth daily delay durations") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Adjust x-axis labels for readability
```

---

**User:**  
I need you to fix Plot 3 (pie chart) — it doesn’t work well.

---

**Assistant:**  
Here’s an improved version of **Figure 3** using a bar chart instead of a pie chart to better compare total delays by subway line:

```r
# Aggregate total delays by line
line_delay <- data %>%
  group_by(Line) %>%
  summarise(Total_Delay = sum(`Min Delay`, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot: Total delay by subway line (Bar Chart)
ggplot(line_delay, aes(x = reorder(Line, Total_Delay), y = Total_Delay, fill = Line)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +  # Hide legend since it's redundant
  labs(title = "Total Delay Duration by Subway Line",
       x = "Subway Line",
       y = "Total Delay (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")  # Apply a visually appealing color palette
```
