The dataset includes variables such as date, time, station, delay codes, and duration of delays.  The research aim to identify the most common causes of delays and the stations by exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling. Furthermore, the analysis assesses the impact of delays on service gaps and vehicle operations. Also, the reason should provide insights into peak delay times and their correlation with specific lines or stations. By highlighting delay trends and their operational consequences, this paper offers actionable insights for improving the efficiency of Torontoâ€™s subway system. The findings contribute to public transportation research and serve as a resource for transit authorities to mitigate future delays and enhance commuter experience.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
