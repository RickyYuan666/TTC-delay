## A Comprehensive Analysis of Delay Patterns and Operational Efficiency in the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) Subway System

This repository contains data analysis and visualizations related to subway delays at the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in 2023. 
The project uses open data from the OpenDataToronto portal to analyze delay patterns at individual stations and subway lines. 
The goal of the project was to identify key trends in subway delays and provide insights that can help improve transit efficiency. 
The analysis has detailed documentation, R scripts, and visualization outputs. It is good for people who are interested in the reason for the TTC delay.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Part of the code was written with the help of the AI tool ChatGPT. The entire chat can be viewed in \other\llm.
